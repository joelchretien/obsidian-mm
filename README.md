## Install
### Docker
The docker-compose.yml file will allow you to run the image containing the web application as well as the postgres database required to run it.
```
git clone git@github.com:joelchretien/obsidian-mm.git
cd obsidian-mm
docker-compose build
docker-compose up -d
```
 
The image should then be running on your machine.  Connect to http://localhost:3000 to access the application.
 
## Tests
A convenience script is present to help run specs in docker.  It can be run using the following command.
```
./runTestsInDocker.sh
```
